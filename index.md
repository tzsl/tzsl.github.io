I'am a webbuilder with Drupal, but I want to develop a litte bit, so I have to study **GIT** 

I have made 3 operational websites with drupal
- [Popkoor Multivocaal](https://multivocaal.nl)
- [Molen de Lastdrager](https://molendelastdrager.nl)
- [Molen de Hoop](https://dehoopwieringerwaard.nl)

I use as theme _MAYO_. This theme is only available for version 7 and 8. Now i have made it compatible for version 9 but not in the right way, so I have to learn to do this with git
