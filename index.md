# Welcome to the website TZSL

I'am a webbuilder with Drupal, but I want to develop a litte bit, so I have to study **GIT** 

I have made 3 operational websites with drupal
-[Link]multivocaal.nl
-[Link]molendelastdrager.nl
-[Link]dehoopwieringerwaard.nl

I use as theme _MAYO_. This theme is only available for version 7 and 8. Now i have made it compatible for version 9 but not in the right way, so I have to learn to do this with git

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/tzsl/tzsl.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
