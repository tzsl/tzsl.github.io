# Welcome to the website TZSL

I'am a webbuilder with Drupal, but I want to develop a litte bit, so I have to study **GIT** 

I have made 3 operational websites with drupal
- [Link](multivocaal.nl)
- [Link](molendelastdrager.nl)
- [Link](dehoopwieringerwaard.nl)

I use as theme _MAYO_. This theme is only available for version 7 and 8. Now i have made it compatible for version 9 but not in the right way, so I have to learn to do this with git
